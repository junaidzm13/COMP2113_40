Base: The empty squares on each corner of the board represents the base (i.e. the starting point) of that player.
token symbol: R, Y, G and B are four token symbols representing four different players (Player 1 = R | Player 2 = G | Player 3 = B | Player 4 = Y)
Token representation: <token symbol><token number> (e.g. B1, B2, B3, B4)
xx: Playing area.
SS: Also part of the playing area but is a safe point for everyone. This means a player cannot be killed on these points.
<token symbol>S: Denotes the ultimate safe point of a token with symbol <token symbol> (e.g. BS),
                 where the token cannot be killed, and other player's tokens cannot access these points.
<token symbol>H: Home of the player with token symbol <token symbol> (e.g. BH).

Note: RH: {}, etc. represents the number of tokens that have safely reached home for player with token symbol R. Right now the braces are empty {}. As the tokens reach home, these braces will fill up with these tokens. Similar, to what we have explained in the manual for the points (including safe points) where two or more tokens reside at the same time.

The board above shows that there 4 players reresented by four different token symbols with each player having 4 tokens 
to play. Currently, all tokens for each of the 4 players are in their respective bases as shown above, therefore, they 
are not in the playing area. Once they roll a die on their turn and get a 6, players can select any one of their tokens
to enter the play area. The ultimate goal of each token is to reach their home represented by <token symbol>H.
