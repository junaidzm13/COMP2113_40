token symbol: There are four players (which is token symbol)  in this game. R, Y, G, B are four token symbol.
Token representation: <token symbol><token number> (e.g. B1, B2, B3, B4)
XX: Playing area
SS: Also part of the playing area but is a safe point for everyone. This means a player cannot be killed on these points.
<token symbol>S: Denotes the ultimate safe point of a token with symbol <token symbol>,
                 where you cannot be killed, and other player cannot come to this point and is required to reach home.
<token symbol>H: Home of the player with token symbol <token symbol>. 

-The board above shows that there 4 players/token symbol with each players having 4 tokens to play. Currently, all the tokens of each of 4 players are in their respective bases as shown above, therefore, they are not in playing area. Once they roll a die and get a six, players can select anyone of their token to enter the play area. The ultimate goal of each token is to reach their home <token symbol>H.
