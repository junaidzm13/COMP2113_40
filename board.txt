token symbol: R, Y, G and B are four token symbols representing four different players.
Token representation: <token symbol><token number> (e.g. B1, B2, B3, B4)
XX: Playing area.
SS: Also part of the playing area but is a safe point for everyone. This means a player cannot be killed on these points.
<token symbol>S: Denotes the ultimate safe point of a token with symbol <token symbol> (e.g. BS),
                 where the token cannot be killed, and other player's tokens cannot access these points.
<token symbol>H: Home of the player with token symbol <token symbol> (e.g. BH).

The board above shows that there 4 players reresented by four different token symbols with each player having 4 tokens to play. Currently, all tokens of each of the 4 players are in their respective bases as shown above, therefore, they are not in the playing area. Once they roll a die on their turn and get a 6, players can select anyone of their token to enter the play area. The ultimate goal of each token is to reach their home represented by <token symbol>H.
